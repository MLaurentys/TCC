It is no surprise that avid players of games that resemble a logical or mathematical puzzle, like checkers, develop an intuition that allows them to calculate faster, by asserting bad moves fast, recognizing winning and losing patterns ahead of time or many other strategies. Many times it is not easy to understand or explain how does it work, while others, after seeing a move being played, it is easily possible to explain it by the principles that rule the game. A most essential, and sometime very hard, component of playing well any of these mathematical games is being able to know if you are ahead or behind in a given position.

While evaluating whether a position is winning or losing is already a hard task, with, for example, modern chess engines not agreeing in some positions, it is possible take this problem to higher standards. Imagine you are playing a variant of the game of chess. In this variant, each player is given a set of board positions, and each should choose one board to play as white. During this game, play will take place in each board in parallel, and, whoever checkmates the opponent faster, wins the game. If one wants to be a great player of such game, the knowledge of asserting if a position is winning or loosing in a regular chess game is not enough, nor is the ability to play regular chess perfectly.

The most important ability for this game and for the games that will follow in this paper is to score each position. The ability to calculate the precise advantage a player has over the other is the object of interest of the field called Combinatorial Game Theory.

One of the most brilliant mathematicians of all times, Jonh H. Conway, 


In the letter the mathematician Terrence Tao mourns for the recent passing of John H. Conway, we get a glimpse of the routine of the mathematician who introduced the study of combinatorial games: “Conway was found of hanging out in the Princeton Graduate Lounge (…) often tinkering with some game or device (…) on another occasion he challenged me to a board game he recently invented (now know as “Phutball”) (…) I still remember being repeatedly obliterated in that game”.  It goes unanswered whether he fun or actual research



His paper “On Number and Games” inaugurates the study of mathematical plays. (???? actual garbage??)
