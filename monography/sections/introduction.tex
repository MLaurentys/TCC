It is no surprise that avid players of games that resemble a logical or mathematical puzzle, like checkers, develop an intuition that allows them to calculate faster, by asserting bad moves fast, recognizing winning and losing patterns ahead of time or many other strategies. Many times, it is not easy to understand or explain how does it work, while others, after seeing a move being played, it is easily possible to explain it by the principles that rule the game. A most essential, and sometime very hard, component of playing well any of these mathematical games is being able to know if you are ahead or behind in a given position.

While evaluating whether a position is winning or losing is already a hard task, with, for example, modern chess engines not agreeing in some positions, it is possible take this problem to higher standards. Imagine you are playing a variant of the game of chess. In this variant, each player is given a set of board positions, and each should choose one board to play as white. During this game, play will take place in each board in parallel, and, whoever checkmates the opponent faster, wins the game. If one wants to be a great player of such game, the knowledge of asserting if a position is winning or loosing in a regular chess game is not enough, nor is the ability to play regular chess perfectly.

The most important ability for this game and for the games that will follow in this paper is to score each position. The ability to calculate the precise advantage a player has over the other is the object of interest of the field called Combinatorial Game Theory, inaugurated in \todo{1970} by the paper \todo{ONAG}. The author of that paper, Jonh H. Conway, as found in the epigraph that starts this text, was, as many, an avid player of such games, however, unlike all others, was one of the brightest minds in the history of mathematics.

Dr. Conway realized that some games, to be defined in the next chapter, behave like numbers in every aspect. While, initially, that seems very useful to calculate the advantages, and win in the presented variation of chess, this realization means much more than this tool. It is true that some way of modeling the problem of assigning values to positions was the initial challenge and this would be a great step towards it; however, what came out from Conway's work was a \todo{match} between positions and numbers, not a measure of the position.

This \todo{match}, that is further explained in the following chapters and the main topic in this field of study, is built upon a new set of numbers. This special set of numbers was created, or discovered, when piecing together the necessary element to analyze any particular game: its game tree. Of course a computer program could traverse a game tree and tell who is winning the game, but it would not be able to easily tell who would be winning if two game trees were added. \todo{citation!} Even defining how to meaningfully merge game trees is problematic.

Not only does the \todo{system} created by the \todo{magical genius}\footnote{blabla}, Conway, gives the ability to add, but it also defines a method to multiply games. However, in order to define such methods, the definition of that new set of numbers was necessary. The Surreal Numbers, name given by Donald Knuth\footnote{The original name was...}, \todo{for starters}, were required as, in this \todo{system}, the number \todo{matching} a position might not belong to the set of real numbers.

As some might understand from the title alone, however, the focus of this text are in the non-numbers. It is possible for games to be \todo{unwritable} as a surreal number, although every surreal number has correspondent\footnote{Any surreal number is \todo{matched} by an infinite number of games} games. The concept of temperate, by consequence the concepts of hotness and coolness, however, does not forego the understanding of numbers.

The rest of this chapter relies on the next chapters. Skipping for now.

\textcolor{red}{(The Introduction chapter should contain background information as appropriate, plus definitions of all special and general terms. Your topic should be: clearly stated and defined; have a clear overall purpose; and have clear, relevant and coherent aims and objectives.
